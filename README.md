## WC Clone

This is a clone of the `wc` (word count) unix command line tool I made in Python inspired by https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc

I made this in pretty much 1 night throwing together a weird mixture of MVC and Clean Architecture after everything had been refactored.

This was kind of cool to make because I was able to practice:
- Dataclasses
- Protocols
- Argparse
- Dependency Injection
- Poetry (by setting up the project)
